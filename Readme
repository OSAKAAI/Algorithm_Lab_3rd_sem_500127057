Overview of Experiments
This document provides a summary of the experiments I have conducted as part of the coursework on algorithms.

List of Experiments :-
1. Iterative and Recursive Binary Search Tree Insertion
Objective: Implement both iterative and recursive methods for inserting elements into a Binary Search Tree (BST).
Experiment: Compare the performance of the two insertion methods using different tree sizes, and visualize the results by plotting their execution times.
Status: completed.

2. Merge Sort vs Quick Sort (Divide and Conquer Approach)
Objective: Implement the divide and conquer-based algorithms: Merge Sort and Quick Sort.
Experiment: Compare the performance of Merge Sort and Quick Sort by running both algorithms on the same set of elements and analyzing the differences in execution time.
Status: completed.

3. Strassen's Matrix Multiplication vs Traditional Matrix Multiplication
Objective: Implement Strassenâ€™s matrix multiplication algorithm and compare its performance with the traditional matrix multiplication technique.
Experiment: Compare the execution times and performance of both methods, focusing on time complexity and efficiency with large matrices.
Status: completed.

4. Activity Selection Problem (Greedy Algorithm)
Objective: Implement the Activity Selection problem using a greedy algorithm approach.
Experiment: Solve the problem to understand the effectiveness of the greedy strategy, and verify how it finds an optimal solution.
Status: completed.
